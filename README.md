# Linux-Automation-Scripts  

This repository consists of many handy Bash-written scripts that automate configuration of fresh Linux Mint install.  
Because I am fan of automation and hater of wasting my own time, I created those scripts to help me.  

Initially I uploaded them to [my GitHub gists profile](https://gist.github.com/tTargiel) on 28.09.2022, but own repository seems to be far better future-proof choice.  
As said - that's just the start, in the future, I will surely upload more of similiar automatizations.
